# Projects
This is an area where I will upload coding projects both to showcase my abilities and document my improvement.
This README will constantly be updated when I create more projects.


Project 1: Draw Random Card
  I developed this project to improve my current skills in python, I understood that I would have to deal with more complicated data structures in the future such as linked lists, trees and tris. I wanted to first improve on the skills that I would encounter next, that would be none other than classes, or object-oriented programming. I developed the draw random card class by strictly using object-oriented programming, This served as a benchmark and an introduction for my journey into object-oriented programming.

  
Project 2:
  The second project I developed was a continuation off of my first one, I was able to create a program using object oriented programming to draw any random card that I wanted, but since I had already devled a little bit into the world of cards, I decided to delve a little bit deeper. I'll admit, I've done "projects" before where I tried following somebody elses code to understand it better, but for these projects I made sure to do everything myself. Everything that you see within this repository is my own creation without external sources like internet tutorials to help me. So I created the War cardgame, comparing two randomly drawn cards and then declaring a winner.

  
  Project 3:
    The third project I created was a continuation of the aforementioned projects, but I wanted to increase the complexity. I don't actually play many card games but one of the ones that I'll play for fun is Blackjack. I decided to code a python script where it was like playing Blackjack on your own computer. Completely harmless as there is no money involved, just a fun card game between you and the dealer, going for as long as you don't get bankrupt.
